# What Worked Well

Several configurations in the rules file noticeably improved the AI agent’s behavior:

- Enforcing a “think before coding” rule reduced premature code generation and improved solution accuracy.
- Requiring the agent to restate the problem and identify assumptions helped surface unclear requirements early.
- Adding planning and decomposition steps led to more structured and maintainable solutions.
- Explicit hallucination prevention rules reduced incorrect or made-up APIs and libraries.
- Separating analysis, solution, and risk sections made responses easier to evaluate and trust.

Overall, the agent became more aligned with how I normally reason about software problems.
