# What Didn’t Work and Challenges Faced

Initially, the AI agent tended to jump directly into writing code without sufficient context or planning. This resulted in solutions that were technically correct but misaligned with my intent.

In early versions of the rules, being too strict about explanations caused responses to become overly verbose. I addressed this by refining verbosity expectations while keeping the planning steps intact.

I also encountered moments where the agent still made assumptions instead of asking clarifying questions. This was mitigated by explicitly instructing the agent to treat ambiguity as a signal to pause and ask.

These challenges were resolved through small, iterative changes rather than rewriting the rules entirely.
