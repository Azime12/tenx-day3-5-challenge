# Task 3 – Documentation

## What I Did

I configured my coding environment using VS Code and connected it to the Tenx MCP server following the provided MCP Analysis Documentation. Once the MCP connection was active, I focused on improving how the AI coding agent collaborates with me by refining its rules file.

I created and iteratively updated the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to define:
- How the AI agent should reason before coding
- How it should handle ambiguity and missing requirements
- Expectations around code quality, structure, and maintainability
- Clear behavior for debugging, reviewing, and explaining decisions

The rules were inspired by best practices discussed by Boris Cherny (Claude Code) and broader community workflows that emphasize deliberate planning, explicit reasoning, and treating AI agents as collaborators rather than autocomplete tools.

After each update, I tested the agent on real development tasks to observe behavioral changes and adjusted the rules accordingly.
