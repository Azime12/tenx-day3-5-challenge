# Project Chimera: Autonomous Influencer Network

**Project Chimera** is a multi-agent system designed for autonomous AI influencers. It leverages a hierarchical swarm architecture (Planner–Worker–Judge) to research trends, create multimedia content, and manage economic engagement.

## Core Pillars
- **Hierarchical Swarms**: Using the FastRender pattern.
- **MCP Native**: All external integrations via Model Context Protocol.
- **Agentic Commerce**: On-chain autonomy via Coinbase AgentKit.
- **Spec-Driven**: Documentation-first development.

## Governance
This project is governed by the [Project Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md). All contributors and agents MUST adhere to its principles.
