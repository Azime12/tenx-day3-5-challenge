# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Project Chimera: Autonomous Influencer Network

**Project Type**: Multi-agent system for autonomous AI influencers  
**Business Goal**: Create digital entities that autonomously research trends, generate multimedia content, and manage social & economic engagement  
**Core Architecture**: Hierarchical Swarm (FastRender) using Planner–Worker–Judge roles  
**External Integration Standard**: All external API calls MUST go through MCP servers  
**Commerce Standard**: All financial actions MUST use non-custodial wallets via Coinbase AgentKit with strict budget governors  
**Scalability Target**: Support 1,000+ concurrent agents (across campaigns/tenants)

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Pattern: Hierarchical Swarm (FastRender)

The system SHALL use a Hierarchical Swarm architecture with distinct agent roles:

- **Planner (Strategist)**: Converts high-level goals into a structured queue of Tasks.
- **Worker (Executor)**: Performs isolated, specialized work to produce Results.
- **Judge (Validator)**: Evaluates Results for quality, safety, policy compliance, and confidence; routes outcomes.

The architecture MUST support:

- **Parallel execution**: Multiple Workers can execute Tasks concurrently.
- **Fault isolation**: A Worker failure MUST NOT crash the swarm; Tasks MUST be retried or reassigned.
- **Deterministic routing**: Judge decisions MUST be driven by policy rules and confidence thresholds.
- **Auditability**: The system MUST record task lineage and approvals for publishing and spending actions.

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. **Planner → Orchestrator**: Planner submits `Task` objects to the orchestrator queue.
2. **Orchestrator → Worker**: Orchestrator assigns Tasks to Workers based on capability/skill requirements.
3. **Worker → Judge**: Worker returns `Result` objects for evaluation.
4. **Judge → Orchestrator**: Judge returns an `evaluation` (approve/reject/escalate) and confidence, plus required next actions.
5. **Orchestrator → Action**: If approved, orchestrator triggers MCP-based publishing/commerce; otherwise routes to retry/HITL queue.

## 2. Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Planner (Strategist)

- **Inputs**
  - Campaign goal(s) (e.g., “increase follower engagement by 15% in 30 days”)
  - Platform constraints (per platform policies)
  - Budget constraints (per tenant/campaign)
  - Historical performance summaries (optional)
- **Core Logic**
  - MUST decompose goals into discrete, testable `Task`s with clear success criteria.
  - MUST assign each Task a `skill` requirement (e.g., `skill_trend_research`).
  - MUST set `risk_level` and `requires_human_review` flags for sensitive domains.
  - MUST NOT directly call external APIs (MCP-only constraint applies system-wide).
- **Outputs**
  - One or more `Task` objects pushed to the orchestrator queue.
- **Failure Modes (and required behavior)**
  - **Invalid task definition**: MUST fail fast with an error reason; MUST NOT enqueue incomplete Tasks.
  - **Policy conflict (e.g., forbidden topic)**: MUST mark Task as `blocked` and route to HITL with rationale.
  - **Budget conflict**: MUST reduce scope or request HITL approval; MUST NOT bypass budget governors.

### 2.2 Worker (Executor)

- **Inputs**
  - A `Task` object from the orchestrator, including `skill` requirement and constraints
- **Core Logic**
  - MUST execute Tasks in an isolated, side-effect-controlled manner.
  - MUST use MCP servers for all external reads/writes.
  - MUST produce a `Result` object with complete artifacts and evidence (sources, prompts, URLs, receipts).
  - MUST NOT publish content or spend funds directly unless the Task explicitly authorizes it AND the action is performed via orchestrator-controlled MCP calls.
- **Outputs**
  - A `Result` object returned to the Judge.
- **Failure Modes (and required behavior)**
  - **MCP server unavailable**: MUST return `status=error` with retryable flag and diagnostic context.
  - **Timeout**: MUST return partial evidence (if any) and mark as retryable.
  - **Policy violation detected**: MUST stop, return `status=blocked`, and include violation details.

### 2.3 Judge (Validator)

- **Inputs**
  - A `Result` object
  - Applicable policies (brand safety, platform rules, spending limits, disclosure requirements)
  - Optional context: prior rejections, human feedback, campaign constraints
- **Core Logic**
  - MUST evaluate quality, safety, and compliance.
  - MUST compute a `confidence_score` in \([0.0, 1.0]\) and provide reasons.
  - MUST enforce HITL routing rules (Section 5).
  - MUST enforce “AI disclosure when directly asked” policy for interactive outputs.
- **Outputs**
  - An `evaluation` decision: `approve` | `reject` | `escalate_to_human` | `retry`
  - Required next action(s) and policy tags
- **Failure Modes (and required behavior)**
  - **Insufficient evidence**: MUST `retry` or `escalate_to_human` (never auto-approve).
  - **Conflicting policies**: MUST escalate to human with full rationale.
  - **Repeated failure loop**: MUST trigger escalation after a bounded retry count (see Section 5.4).

## 3. Skills Framework Definition (Strict I/O Contracts)

All skills MUST:

- Accept **only** the inputs defined by contract (additional fields MUST be rejected or ignored per policy).
- Return outputs that validate against the output contract.
- Return deterministic, structured errors with machine-readable codes.
- Perform all external I/O through MCP servers.

```

### 4.3 Orchestrator Dashboard API Endpoints

The system SHALL expose an Orchestrator Dashboard API for operators and HITL reviewers.
Endpoints MUST be authenticated and audited. Endpoints are described at the contract level.

- **GET `/api/v1/health`**
  - **MUST** return service health, version, and dependency readiness (including MCP servers).
- **GET `/api/v1/tasks`**
  - **MUST** support filtering by `tenant_id`, `campaign_id`, `status`, `risk_level`, and time range.
- **GET `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`**
  - **MUST** return the Task plus linked Results and Judge evaluations (by correlation).
- **POST `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/retry`**
  - **MUST** enqueue a retry attempt (bounded by `max_attempts`), preserving lineage.
- **GET `/api/v1/review-queue`**
  - **MUST** return HITL items ordered by priority and SLA deadline.
- **POST `/api/v1/review-queue/{item_id}/decision`**
  - **MUST** accept `approve` | `edit_and_approve` | `reject` with reviewer identity and rationale.
  - **MUST** write an immutable audit log entry.
- **GET `/api/v1/audit/events`**
  - **MUST** support filter by `correlation_id`, entity IDs, event type, and time range.
- **GET `/api/v1/metrics`**
  - **MUST** expose operational metrics (queue depth, approval rates, retries, p95 latencies).

---

## 5. Safety & Governance (HITL)

### 5.1 Confidence-Based Tiers (Exact Thresholds)

Every Judge evaluation MUST produce a `confidence_score` in \([0.0, 1.0]\). The system MUST route actions as follows:

- **Tier 1 (Auto-Approve)**: `confidence_score > 0.90`
  - Allowed only when `risk_level` is `low` or `medium` AND the action is not sensitive/financial.
- **Tier 2 (Async HITL Review)**: `0.70 <= confidence_score <= 0.90`
  - MUST be routed to the Human Review Queue.
  - The agent swarm MAY continue non-dependent work while awaiting review.
- **Tier 3 (Retry / Block)**: `confidence_score < 0.70`
  - MUST trigger `retry` with refinement guidance OR immediate escalation if risk is high.

### 5.2 Mandatory HITL Overrides (Regardless of Confidence)

The following MUST ALWAYS route to HITL, even if `confidence_score > 0.90`:

- `risk_level` is `financial` (any wallet/spend/transfer action)
- `risk_level` is `sensitive` (politics/health/finance advice/harassment/minors/etc.)
- First-time actions on a new platform/account/tenant configuration (until explicitly whitelisted)

### 5.3 Routing Logic (Deterministic)

Routing MUST be computed deterministically from:

- `risk_level`
- `requires_human_review` flag (if set true, always route to HITL)
- `confidence_score`
- policy tags (e.g., `sensitive:health`, `financial:transfer`)

### 5.4 Retry Bounding (Anti-Loop Requirement)

For any Task:

- The system MUST cap attempts to `max_attempts` (default: 3 unless explicitly set).
- If attempts are exhausted, the system MUST escalate to HITL with the complete evidence history.

---

## 6. Deployment & Scalability

### 6.1 Container Strategy (Docker)

- Each major service (Orchestrator, Planner service, Worker service, Judge service, Dashboard API) MUST be containerized.
- Containers MUST be immutable and versioned.
- Secrets MUST be injected at runtime (never baked into images).

### 6.2 Cluster Orchestration (Kubernetes)

The production deployment SHOULD run on Kubernetes and MUST support horizontal scaling:

- Worker and Judge pools MUST support horizontal autoscaling based on queue depth and CPU/memory.
- Orchestrator MUST be deployed with high availability (at least 2 replicas) and leader-safe queue semantics.
- MCP servers MUST be monitored as dependencies; degraded MCP availability MUST be visible in `/api/v1/health`.

### 6.3 CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

The CI/CD pipeline MUST enforce:

- **Build**: deterministic builds producing versioned images.
- **Test**: unit tests for policy/routing logic; integration tests for MCP contracts (mocked or sandboxed).
- **Security**: secret scanning and dependency vulnerability scanning.
- **Policy checks**: fail builds if non-MCP external calls are detected (static checks where possible).
- **Deployment**: staged rollout (dev → staging → prod) with rollback capability.
