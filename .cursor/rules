# Project Chimera - Cursor Rules

## Structural Requirements
The project MUST maintain the following structure. Any change that removes these is a breaking change:
- `specs/`: Master and feature specifications.
- `tests/`: TDD red-baseline and integration tests.
- `skills/`: Capability packages for agents.
- `Dockerfile` & `Makefile`: Build and environment automation.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD automation.
- `.cursor/rules`: This file.

## Development Standards
1. **Spec-First**: No implementation without a corresponding specification change or reference.
2. **TDD-Mandatory**: Every new feature must start with a failing test in `tests/`.
3. **Encoding**: All files MUST be UTF-8 (No BOM/No UTF-16).
4. **Agentic Style**: Follow the Antigravity agent patterns (Planner/Worker/Judge).
5. **Security**: Zero tolerance for hardcoded secrets. Use `.env`.
