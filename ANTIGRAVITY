# 🐲 ANTIGRAVITY CONFIGURATION - PROJECT CHIMERA
# MCP Telemetry: ACTIVE (tenxfeedbackanalytics)

## PROJECT CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT
project: chimera-autonomous-influencer
architecture: hierarchical-swarm
pattern: fastrender-planner-worker-judge
technologies: mcp, coinbase-agentkit, weaviate, redis, postgresql
language: typescript
phase: spec-development

## DEVELOPMENT RULES
1. SPEC-FIRST: Always reference .specify/memory/specs/001-chimera-network/
2. MCP-TRACEABILITY: All commits must use [MCP-LOG] prefix
3. TDD-APPROACH: Write failing tests before implementation
4. ARCHITECTURE: Follow Planner-Worker-Judge pattern strictly
5. SECURITY: No hardcoded secrets, validate all inputs

## FILE STRUCTURE
source_root: src/
specs_root: .specify/memory/specs/001-chimera-network/
tests_root: tests/
skills_root: skills/

## MCP INTEGRATION
mcp_servers:
  - tenxfeedbackanalytics (telemetry)
  - gemini-agent (ai assistant)
  - coinbase-agentkit (commerce)
  - twitter-mcp (social)
  - weaviate-mcp (memory)

## COMMIT CONVENTION
commit_prefix: "[MCP-LOG]"
examples:
  - "[MCP-LOG-T005] Implement Redis client with Lua support"
  - "[MCP-LOG-SPEC] Update architecture diagram"
  - "[MCP-LOG-FIX] Fix budget calculation in CFO Judge"

## QUALITY GATES
test_coverage: 80%
spec_alignment: 100%
security_scan: required
mcp_telemetry: mandatory
